This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

# Assignment of Module 13

## Assignment Title: Building a Cookie-Based Web App with Next.js 13

### Assignment Description:

- [-] In this assignment, you will create a simple web application using Next.js 13 that uses cookies to store user preferences, responds with JSON data, and handles redirection and header modification.

### Assignment Requirements:

#### Setting Cookies:

Create a Next.js project using version 13.

- [x] Implement a route that sets a cookie when a user clicks a button. The cookie should store a user preference, eg, "theme: dark" or "language: en".

#### Reading Cookies:

- [x] Implement another route that reads the user's preference cookie and displays it on the page.

#### JSON Response:

- [] Create a route that returns a JSON response with the following data:

{

"message": "Welcome to our API!",

"version": "1.0"

}

#### Redirection:

- [] Implement a route that redirects the user to a different page within your application using NextResponse.redirect().

#### Header Modification:

- [] Create a route that accepts an incoming request with an "Authorization" header.

- [] Extract the token from the header, prefix it with "Bearer", and add it as a new "Authorization" header.

- [] Use NextResponse.next() to produce the response.

- [] Styling: Feel free to style with any of the CSS framework
